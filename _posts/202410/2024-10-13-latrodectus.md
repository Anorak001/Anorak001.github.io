In today’s ever-changing world of cybersecurity, it feels like there’s always something new to watch out for. Staying knowledgeable is crucial to keeping ourselves safe. One of the latest threats causing a stir is Latrodectus ( discovered in jan2024) . It’s not only hard to say, it’s also hard to detect; it’s clever, sneaky, and poses a real threat to both people and businesses. In this article we dive into the world of Latrodectus, uncover how it operates, and most importantly, learn how to avoid it entirely.

## What is Latrodectus?

Latrodectus is a sophisticated form of malware that operates stealthily within computer systems, often evading detection until it’s too late. Named after the notorious black widow spider, this malicious software shares similar traits with its namesake, lurking in the shadows and striking when least expected.

## Characteristics of Latrodectus:

Latrodectus exhibits several characteristics that set it apart from other types of malware:

  1. Evasion: it is adept at passing through Sandboxes undetected.  It does this by counting running processes and comparing to real-world scenarios.  Not enough processes, and may be in a sandbox.  Is their a valid MAC address?  No MAC means sandbox.  If either condition is found, hide!  That’s how devious Latrodectus is!
  2. Stealth: It conceals its presence within a compromised system successfully hiding from traditional security tools like AV and EDR.
  3. Persistence: Once Latrodectus infiltrates a system, it establishes persistence, ensuring its continued operation even after system reboots by setting an autorun  key.
  4. Data Theft: One of Latrodectus’s primary objectives is to steal sensitive information from its victims, including personal data, financial credentials, and intellectual property.  It is believed that Latrodectus has roots in malware first seen in 2017 as a banking trojan.
  5. Remote Control: Latrodectus often includes remote access capabilities, allowing malicious actors to control infected systems remotely and carry out additional attacks.  It does this through a constantly changing set of Command and Control servers.
  6. Encryption: In some cases, Latrodectus encrypts files on infected systems, demanding ransom payments from victims in exchange for decryption keys.

Now that you have a clear understanding of the various capabilities of Latrodectus, let’s move on to the ways in which you can be infected so you can avoid it.

## Infiltration Tactics:

  1.  Phishing: Malicious actors distribute phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links that, when clicked, download and execute Latrodectus onto the victim’s system.  Sometimes this is accomplished using JavaScript while other times, it calls embedded DLLs.
  2.   Exploiting Vulnerabilities: Latrodectus exploits known vulnerabilities in software applications or operating systems to gain unauthorized access to target systems.  Proofpoint and team CYMRU worked together to reverse engineer Latrodectus capabilities.
 3.   Malicious Websites: Users may inadvertently download Latrodectus from compromised or malicious websites that host exploit kits capable of delivering the malware to unsuspecting visitors.


## Mitigation Strategies:

Protecting against Latrodectus and similar malware requires a multi-faceted approach to cybersecurity. Here are some essential strategies for mitigating the risks associated with Latrodectus.  These preventative measures help protect against most major cybersecurity threats to your company, network, data, systems, and people:

1.    Remove Administrative Rights: Limit user permissions by removing administrative rights from workstations. This reduces the likelihood of users accidentally installing malware, as Latrodectus requires elevated privileges to execute.
 2.   Cyber Literacy Training: Conduct regular cyber literacy training sessions for employees and subcontractors. Utilize awareness videos to educate them on social engineering tactics, phishing attacks, and best practices for password hygiene.  This could prevent an errant click that leads to a Latrodectus infection.
3.    Phishing Simulation Testing: Test employees’ awareness and response to phishing attacks using hyper-realistic simulations. Platforms like CyberHoot offer tons of phishing simulations that mimic real-world threats, helping employees recognize and report suspicious emails effectively.  Not clicking on malicious links or websites is a strong defense against Latrodectus infection.
4.    Cyber Insurance Coverage: Invest in cyber insurance to provide financial protection in the event of a security breach or cyber incident. Cyber insurance can help mitigate the costs associated with data breaches, ransomware attacks, and other adverse cyber events, offering peace of mind when preventive measures fall short.

The remainder of these suggestions help build a robust, defense-in-depth cybersecurity program that addresses multiple areas of risk.  The above suggestions are focused on preventing Latrodectus infections from starting to begin with.  Cyber Insurance is always a great recover measure when an infection sneaks through.

1.    Trusted Software Installation: Allow only trusted employees to install software from reputable sources. Discourage the use of unverified sources such as Dropbox folders, which can serve as initial attack vectors for malware like Latrodectus.
2.    Email Alert Banner: Implement email alert banners for messages originating from outside the organization. This serves as a visual cue to employees, reminding them to exercise caution when interacting with external emails, especially those requesting software installations like VPN clients.
3.    Annual Risk Assessment: Perform an annual risk assessment of your organization, including comprehensive vulnerability scanning and penetration testing. Identifying weaknesses in your security posture allows for targeted remediation efforts to mitigate potential Latrodectus vulnerabilities.
4.    Risk Management Framework: Establish a risk management framework tailored to your organization’s needs. This framework should include processes for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks associated with Latrodectus and other cybersecurity threats.
5.    Virtual CISO Consultation: Consider hiring a virtual Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) to provide expertise in risk assessment, cybersecurity program development, and risk mitigation strategies. A virtual CISO can help augment your organization’s cybersecurity capabilities and ensure alignment with industry best practices.
6.    Govern Software Installation: Establish policies that prohibit employees from installing software without involvement from the IT department. This helps prevent unauthorized installations of potentially malicious programs like Latrodectus.

## Conclusion:

Sun Tzu wrote the following over 2000 years ago in his Treatise on ware called “The Art of War” and it applies to Latrodectus today as it did his enemies all those years ago:

“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”

Latrodectus is no joke when it comes to putting folks, businesses, and organizations at risk. But as Sun Tzu wrote above, know yourself (strengths and weaknesses) and your enemy (attack methods for example)  and you will win the war against hackers. By getting a handle on how to keep Latrodectus at bay, improving your defenses, strengthening your weaknesses, and understanding your enemy, will help. So, keep your guard up, stay ahead of the game, and together, we can keep Latrodectus in check.
