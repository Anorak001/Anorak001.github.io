# PConT - Proxy Automation Tool

## Introduction

Hello Everyone!

You might have heard about how `proxychains` work, but a major drawback is the need to manually search for free proxies and configure the `/etc/proxychains.conf` file.

To solve this, **PConT** automates the entire process. Below, you'll find steps on how to use this tool and the expected output. Thanks for using the tool, and feedback is appreciated!


## What is PConT?

- **Integration Ready**: Easily integrate proxy management into your existing tools.
- **Configurable Execution**: Customize script behavior as per your requirements.

## Important Notes

- The proxies are sourced from [proxyscrape.com](https://www.proxyscrape.com/). I do not own them.
- A new feature is coming soon to mitigate potential proxy-related issues.
- While I cannot guarantee 100% safety, these proxies are **safer than most VPNs**.
