# Organizing Your Protections with the MITRE ATT\&CK Framework

Information security isnâ€™t just about policies, standards, or proceduresâ€”itâ€™s also about **understanding how attackers operate in the real world**. While governance lays the foundation, true defense requires anticipating adversary actions and designing both **protective and detective controls**.

Even after putting in firewalls, endpoint security, monitoring, and access controls, the question remains:

 *How do you ensure that your assets are protected and that you can detect any attempts to compromise them?*

The best way is to think like an attacker. By studying what attackers are likely to do, you can build defenses that both **block attacks** and **reveal intrusions in progress**.

Several frameworks exist for this purpose, such as the **Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain** and the **FireEye Mandiant Attack Lifecycle**. However, for a **deeper, more technical, and constantly updated view of adversary tactics**, nothing comes close to the **MITRE ATT\&CK Framework**.

 

## What is the MITRE ATT\&CK Framework?

The MITRE Corporation introduced **ATT\&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge)** in 2013. Unlike traditional frameworks, ATT\&CK dives into the **tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)** used by attackers in real-world incidents.

MITREâ€™s idea was simple:

* Collect attacker behaviors (TTPs).
* Categorize them.
* Continuously update the framework as new methods emerge.

This approach transformed ATT\&CK into a **living knowledge base of adversary behavior**â€”one that defenders can map against their own environment to identify **gaps in protection, detection, and response**.

While some attackers (like hacktivists) may only aim to make noise or cause disruption, the **real danger lies with Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**. These groups infiltrate networks, stay hidden, and operate over long periodsâ€”sometimes **years at a time**.

There are known cases where attackers remained inside organizations for **7â€“10 years**, extracting value quietly while avoiding detection. This is exactly the type of threat MITRE ATT\&CK helps defend against.

## The Stages of the ATT\&CK Framework

The **ATT\&CK Matrix** is broken down into stages, or "tactics," that represent an attackerâ€™s objectives. Each stage includes multiple techniques, and attackers may **move back and forth** between them depending on their goals.

Hereâ€™s a walkthrough of the stages:

### 1. Reconnaissance

The attacker gathers intelligence about the target:

* Searching public and private sources.
* Performing scanning activities.
* Using phishing techniques to trick users into revealing sensitive data.

**Goal:** Understand the environment before launching the attack.

 

### 2. Resource Development

Before striking, attackers build the infrastructure they need:

* Registering malicious domains.
* Creating fake accounts.
* Compromising systems to use as attack platforms.
* Acquiring or renting tools from underground markets.

**Goal:** Prepare the tools and resources for launching operations.

 

### 3. Initial Access

The attacker gains a **foothold**:

* Exploiting public-facing applications.
* Delivering malware through phishing.
* Using stolen credentials.

**Goal:** Get the first step inside the targetâ€™s environment.

 

### 4. Execution

Once inside, attackers need to run code:

* Scheduled tasks.
* Interprocess communication.
* Abuse of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).
* Exploiting system services.

**Goal:** Run their malicious payload without direct user interaction.

 

### 5. Persistence

Attackers donâ€™t want to lose access after a reboot or logout:

* Installing malicious services.
* Modifying registry keys or startup files.
* Leveraging scheduled tasks or cron jobs.

**Goal:** Maintain long-term access to compromised systems.

 

### 6. Privilege Escalation

With persistence established, attackers often want more power:

* Exploiting system vulnerabilities.
* Injecting into privileged processes.
* Running services at boot time.

**Goal:** Gain administrative or system-level control.

 

### 7. Defense Evasion

To stay hidden, attackers use stealth techniques:

* Rootkits to hide presence.
* Obfuscating or encrypting payloads.
* Deleting logs.

This stage has the **largest number of techniques**, since evading detection is essential for survival.

 

### 8. Credential Access

Stolen credentials are valuable for deeper access:

* Phishing users for usernames and passwords.
* Dumping credentials from memory or apps.
* Trick servers into handing over authentication data.

**Goal:** Expand access and impersonate legitimate users.

 

### 9. Discovery

Once inside, attackers **map the environment**:

* Enumerating systems and applications.
* Identifying what resources the victim has access to.

**Goal:** Learn where to move next.

 

### 10. Lateral Movement

Attackers spread deeper into the environment:

* Reusing stolen credentials.
* Exploiting vulnerabilities in other systems.
* Sending malicious emails from compromised accounts.

**Goal:** Compromise as many systems as possible.

 

### 11. Collection

Attackers gather the information they came for:

* Internal documents.
* Databases.
* Credentials and sensitive records.

This stage often leaves **visible artifacts**, such as oddly named files or large archives being staged.

 

### 12. Command and Control (C2)

Attackers establish remote control to maintain presence:

* Using HTTP, DNS, or ICMP for covert communication.
* Embedding commands between infected systems and their C2 servers.

**Goal:** Remotely manage compromised machines.

 

### 13. Exfiltration

The stolen data must leave the environment:

* Over commonly used protocols to blend in.
* By hiding data in DNS queries or HTTP traffic.

Even here, attackers risk detectionâ€”unusually large DNS messages, for example, can expose exfiltration attempts.

 

### 14. Impact

Finally, some attackers may choose to **destroy or disrupt**:

* Ransomware (encrypting data).
* Disk wiping.
* Denial-of-service attacks.

**Goal:** Cause maximum damage, either as retaliation or part of their objective.

 

## Why MITRE ATT\&CK Matters

The power of MITRE ATT\&CK lies in its **practical detail**. Each TTP in the matrix comes with:

* **Descriptions of attacker behavior**
* **Examples from real-world incidents**
* **Mitigation strategies**
* **Detection ideas**

This makes ATT\&CK invaluable for:

* **Blue Teams:** Strengthening monitoring and defenses.
* **Red Teams:** Designing realistic attack simulations.
* **Threat Intelligence Teams:** Mapping adversary campaigns.

It bridges the gap between **high-level strategy** and **hands-on security operations**.

 

## Final Thoughts

Cybersecurity is a constant battle of move and counter-move. The **MITRE ATT\&CK Framework** gives defenders a structured way to anticipate, detect, and respond to the tactics that attackers actually use.

Whether youâ€™re building a SOC, running red team exercises, or simply strengthening your detection capabilities, ATT\&CK is a framework worth mastering.

  *By organizing your defenses with MITRE ATT\&CK, youâ€™re not just reacting to threatsâ€”youâ€™re proactively preparing for them.*
