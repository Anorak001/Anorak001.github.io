# Introduction to Cyber Threat Hunting

Cyber threat hunting is the proactive search for cyber threats that may be hiding undetected within a network. Unlike traditional security measures that wait for alerts, threat hunting actively seeks out malicious actors who have bypassed initial defenses.

Attackers can remain hidden for months, quietly collecting data, searching for confidential information, or stealing credentials to move laterally across the environment. Many organizations lack the advanced detection capabilities to stop these advanced persistent threats (APTs), making threat hunting a crucial part of any defense strategy.

 **Why is threat hunting important?**

 - Helps organizations stay ahead of evolving cyber threats
 - Enables rapid response to potential attacks
 - Complements existing security measures

  

## What is Cyber Threat Hunting?

Threat hunting involves:

- Proactively searching for hidden threats
- Investigating unusual behavior in the network
- Using both human expertise and advanced technology

Once attackers evade detection, threat hunters work to uncover their presence before significant damage occurs.

  

## Threat Hunting Methodologies

Threat hunters operate under the assumption that adversaries are already inside the system. They use three main approaches:

### 1. Hypothesis-Driven Investigation

- Triggered by new threats identified through crowdsourced attack data
- Focuses on discovering if specific attacker behaviors exist in the environment

### 2. Investigation Based on Known Indicators

- Uses threat intelligence to catalog known Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and Indicators of Attack (IOAs)
- These indicators become triggers for uncovering hidden or ongoing attacks

### 3. Advanced Analytics and Machine Learning

- Leverages data analysis and machine learning to detect anomalies
- Anomalies are investigated by analysts to identify stealthy threats

All approaches combine human expertise with technology to proactively protect systems and information.

  

## Steps in the Threat Hunting Process

The proactive threat hunting process typically involves three key steps:

### Step 1: Trigger

- Identifies a specific system or network area for investigation
- Can be based on detection tools or hypotheses about new threats
- Example: Searching for fileless malware that evades traditional defenses

### Step 2: Investigation

- Uses tools like Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) to analyze potential compromises
- Continues until activity is deemed benign or a full picture of malicious behavior is established

### Step 3: Resolution

- Shares intelligence with operations and security teams
- Enables incident response and threat mitigation
- Feeds findings into automated systems to improve future detection

Throughout these steps, threat hunters gather information about attacker actions, analyze trends, eliminate vulnerabilities, and enhance future security.

  

## Where Does Threat Hunting Fit in Security Operations?

Threat hunting complements incident detection, response, and remediation. While security technologies generate alerts, threat hunting uses queries and automation to extract hunting leads from the same data.

**Process Overview:**

- Security tools analyze raw data and generate alerts
- Threat hunters extract leads and investigate signs of adversary activity
- Findings are managed through the incident response pipeline

  

## Should You Use a Managed Threat Hunting Service?

Finding skilled threat hunters is challenging due to a cybersecurity skills shortage. Many organizations turn to managed services for:

- Access to experienced professionals
- 24x7 vigilance
- Cost-effective expertise

### What to Look for in a Threat Hunting Service

A top service should offer:

#### 1. Human Capital

- Skilled analysts with expertise in identifying sophisticated attacks
- Ability to respond to unusual behavior

#### 2. Vast Data Collection

- Ability to gather and store granular system events
- Real-time analysis using scalable cloud infrastructure

#### 3. Threat Intelligence

- Cross-referencing internal data with external threat intelligence
- Use of advanced tools to analyze and correlate malicious actions

Managed services provide the people, data, and analytical tools needed for effective, continuous threat hunting.

  

## How Does Extended Storage Help Threat Hunting?

Retaining security data for longer periods enhances threat hunting by:

- Providing visibility into both real-time and historical data
- Supporting thorough investigation and analysis
- Enabling detection of advanced persistent threats (APTs)

**Benefits:**

- Faster and more accurate threat detection
- Ability to correlate disparate data sets for deeper insights
- Reduced false positives through better-defined detections
- Improved context for investigations, accelerating detection and response

  

By combining skilled professionals, comprehensive data, and advanced analytics, organizations can proactively hunt for threats and strengthen their cybersecurity posture.
